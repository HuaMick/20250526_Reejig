# Your Task:
1. Compare the skills and proficiency levels between the source and target occupations.
2. Identify skills where there is a gap (target requires higher proficiency than source has, or skills missing from source).
3. For each skill gap identified, provide:
   - A clear description of what development is needed
   - Specific recommendations for bridging the gap
   - Context about why this skill is important for the target occupation
4. Focus on actionable insights that would help someone transition from the source to target occupation.

# Output Format Requirements:
Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object with this exact schema:
```json
{
  "skill_gap_analysis": {
    "from_occupation": "string (Source occupation name)",
    "to_occupation": "string (Target occupation name)",
    "skill_gaps": [
      {
        "skill_name": "string (Name of the skill with a gap)",
        "from_proficiency_level": number (Current proficiency level, 0 if skill is missing),
        "to_proficiency_level": number (Required proficiency level for target occupation),
        "gap_description": "string (Detailed description of what development is needed and why this skill matters for the target occupation)"
      }
      // One object for each skill gap identified
    ]
  }
}
```

Ensure your response is properly formatted as valid JSON and includes all required fields.\n\n--- RAW LLM RESPONSE ---\n```json

This includes crafting compelling marketing copy, writing detailed reports, creating engaging content for various platforms (social media, blogs, websites), and producing effective internal communications. The development needed involves improving persuasive writing, storytelling, and adapting writing style to different target audiences and marketing channels. Marketing Managers must be able to create content that drives engagement, generates leads, and builds brand awareness."

This doesn't mean becoming a developer, but rather understanding how websites and marketing automation tools function. Development should focus on learning basic HTML/CSS, understanding APIs, and familiarizing oneself with the capabilities and limitations of common marketing technologies. This knowledge helps Marketing Managers effectively communicate with developers and technical teams, as well as make informed decisions about technology investments."
