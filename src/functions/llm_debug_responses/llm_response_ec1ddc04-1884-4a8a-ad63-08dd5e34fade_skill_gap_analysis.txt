# Your Task:
1. Compare the skills and proficiency levels between the source and target occupations.
2. Identify skills where there is a gap (target requires higher proficiency than source has, or skills missing from source).
3. For each skill gap identified, provide:
   - A clear description of what development is needed
   - Specific recommendations for bridging the gap
   - Context about why this skill is important for the target occupation
4. Focus on actionable insights that would help someone transition from the source to target occupation.

# Output Format Requirements:
Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object with this exact schema:
```json
{
  "skill_gap_analysis": {
    "from_occupation": "string (Source occupation name)",
    "to_occupation": "string (Target occupation name)",
    "skill_gaps": [
      {
        "skill_name": "string (Name of the skill with a gap)",
        "from_proficiency_level": number (Current proficiency level, 0 if skill is missing),
        "to_proficiency_level": number (Required proficiency level for target occupation),
        "gap_description": "string (Detailed description of what development is needed and why this skill matters for the target occupation)"
      }
      // One object for each skill gap identified
    ]
  }
